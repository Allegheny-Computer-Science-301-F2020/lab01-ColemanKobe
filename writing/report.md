### Article 1
 -  Article name.
    - How Your Digital Purchases Could Serve the Perfect Surveillance Network

-  Reference or article citation.
    - https://reason.com/2019/09/03/how-your-digital-purchases-could-serve-the-perfect-surveillance-network/

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
    - The article is about credit card purchases being used to make inferences about people's habits and where they're going to go to purchase things.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
    - The ethical concern is that they can market to me using my transaction data; sharing it without any financial compensation.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
    - Transaction data from credit cards are being manipulated.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
    - When you engage in a card purchase, many corporations can access the data associated with that purchase, such as your bank, the payments network, the store itself, the point-of-sale system, Google Pay, Mint, etc. All of these corporations can share that data amongst certain marketing agencies that may or may not be "affiliates."

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
    - While we as customers gain convenience of a card to use while purchasing, the corporations gain valuable transaction data through means that have high returns on investment.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
     - Uh-Oh: Silicon Valley is Building a Chinese-style Social Credit System

-  Reference or article citation.
    - https://www.fastcompany.com/90394048/uh-oh-silicon-valley-is-building-a-chinese-style-social-credit-system

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
    - The article is about China's establishment of a social credit system that's akin to a financial credit score. We are seeing little things popping up that are like China's social credit system in the US.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
    - The concern is that it could limit your freedom to an unacceptable level, and it's a slippery slope from democracy to corporatocracy.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
    - Social media posts, ratings, what's done in public, memberships to certain groups, ID, etc.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
    - What's done in China is direct public surveillance, where they presumably have cameras in the street, watching for behavior that the Chinese government deems unacceptable. Then, people are either blacklisted or "redlisted"(whitelisted in China). What's being done in the US is similar; not to the degree of China, but relatively close. Insurance companies secondarily base their premium calculations on what you post on social media. PatronScan can scan fake IDs and troublemakers in bars while managing customers. Uber can ban people from using the Uber service based on how the drivers rate them. WhatsApp could ban you if too many people are blocking you.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
    - We as citizens lose tiny bits of our freedom, but the corporations and governments in charge of these forms of analysis gain substantial power.
